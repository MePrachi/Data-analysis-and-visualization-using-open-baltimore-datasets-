This is a Jupytor notebook that shows various data visualizations of the insights that were concluded from merging of datasets.
Initially, the dataset is cleaned, required columns are stored in dataframes and new columns useful for finding out relationships are 
calculated. 
Graphs are generated using matplotlib library and interesting results are plotted using 2D and 3D graphs.
